# Lynx-tournament-scoring-system

The Lynx tournament scoring system was a part of my Unit 4 coursework at college. The project aimed to make a tournament scoring system for a school's game competition (case study). A major part of the code was developed with assistance from my teacher and peers, who were more knowledgeable about the C# language.
At the time, I was new to the coding environment, so I did not know what I was doing. Regardless, I had fun, and this project sparked an interest in coding for me, so I am grateful for the opportunity

### Scenario:

You are a junior employee at a small software development company. Your company recently visited a local college and delivered a guest lecture. The college was pleased with the outcome of the visit and has asked your company to judge an upcoming tournament.

The college will be running a tournament for students to compete in a series of events for prizes.

· Participants may enter the tournament as individuals or as part of a team

· It is expected that there will be 4 teams, each with 5 members, and there will be 20 spaces for individual competitors

· Each team or individual will complete 5 events

· Each event will be defined as a team or individual event

· The events will vary in type, from sporting to academic challenges

· Individuals and teams will be awarded points according to their rank within each event

· The points awarded for each event are yet undecided, and the college is willing to hear any suggestions you may have

· Also, the college would like to include the possibility of entering for one event only.

You have been asked to design and develop a computer program to manage the scoring system for the tournament.
