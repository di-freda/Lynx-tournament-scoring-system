# Lynx-tournament-scoring-system

The Lynx tournament scoring system was a part of my Unit 4 coursework at college. The project aimed to make a tournament scoring system for a school's game competition (case study). A major part of the code was done through assistance from my teacher and peers who were more knowledgeable of the C# language.
At the time, I was new to the coding environment, so I did not know what I was doing. Regardless, I had fun, and this project sparked an interest in coding for me, so I am grateful for the opportunity
